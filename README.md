## My Projects

Project Name  |  Description
-------------  |-------------
Map Tool | Creates a shapefile and web map from text file(s) containing geographic feature names without geometries using FOSS. For example, the tool can read a CSV file of state-level data, create a shapefile containing state polygons with the data attributes, and visualize the data in a web map. 
Contour Generator | Creates contour lines using the arcpy site package by parsing all text files, which contain GPS coordinates of continuous point phemonena, in a target folder. 
Parcels | Contains two Python scripts that automate updating of municipal parcel data using the arcpy site package. <em>UpdateParcels.py</em> creates new attribute fields, calculates values, and renames fields before appending new records to a production feature layer. <em>UpdateAddlParcel.py</em> performs spatial joins and renames fields before appending new records to a production table.
